## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! This project utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies based on user interactions and preferences.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of user ratings and movie metadata. It includes:

1. `movies.csv`: Contains movie information (movieId, title, genres).
2. `ratings.csv`: Contains user ratings for movies (userId, movieId, rating, timestamp).



## ⚙️ Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, use the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🚀 Usage
Clone the repository: https://github.com/Elangovan0101/Movie-Recommendation-System-using-Collaborative-Filtering.git


## 🧠 Model
This system uses collaborative filtering with the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to find similarities between movies based on user ratings. The KNN model is trained using a sparse matrix of the user-movie ratings.
