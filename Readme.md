## 🌟 Introduction

Finding a good movie to watch can be a daunting task with the plethora of options available. This project aims to simplify that by recommending movies based on user ratings using a machine learning approach.

## 📊 Dataset

The datasets used in this project are:

1. `movies.csv`: Contains movie information (movieId, title, genres).
2. `ratings.csv`: Contains user ratings for movies (userId, movieId, rating, timestamp).

## ⚙️ Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage
Ensure that movies.csv and ratings.csv are in the project directory.
Run the script to get movie recommendations:print(get_movie_recommendation('Iron Man'))


🧠 Model Used
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is used to recommend movies based on user ratings. It finds the k-nearest movies to the given movie using cosine similarity.

📈 Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated based on the recommendations it provides. This can be improved by adjusting the number of neighbors and filtering criteria.
